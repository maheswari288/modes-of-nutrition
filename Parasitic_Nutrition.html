        <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #0099ff; margin-top: 30px;">What is Parasitic Nutrition?</h2>
        <p>Parasitic nutrition is a type of nutrition in which an organism, known as a parasite, lives and feeds on another organism, known as a host, for its nutritional requirements.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Parasites obtain their nourishment from the host, often causing harm or damage to the host in the process.</li>
          <li>Parasites may derive nutrients from various sources in the host's body, such as blood, tissues, or the contents of organs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #0099ff; margin-top: 30px;">Types of Parasitic Nutrition</h2>
        <p>There are different types of parasitic nutrition, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Endoparasites:</strong> These parasites live inside the host's body, often in organs or tissues, and derive their nutrition from the host's internal resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Ectoparasites:</strong> These parasites live on the host's external surface, such as the skin or fur, and obtain their nutrition by directly feeding on the host's fluids or tissues.</li>
          <li><strong>Hemiparasites:</strong> These parasites are partially dependent on the host for their nutrition. They have the ability to photosynthesize and produce their own food, but they also extract nutrients from the host's tissues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #0099ff; margin-top: 30px;">Examples of Parasitic Nutrition</h2>
        <p>Some examples of parasitic nutrition include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mosquitoes:</strong> Female mosquitoes feed on the blood of animals or humans to obtain nutrients necessary for egg production.</li>
          <li><strong>Tapeworms:</strong> Tapeworms are endoparasites that live in the intestines of animals, including humans. They absorb nutrients from the host's digested food.</li>
          <li><strong>Fleas:</strong> Fleas are ectoparasites that feed on the blood of animals. They pierce the host's skin to extract blood and obtain nutrients.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #0099ff; margin-top: 30px;">Impact of Parasitic Nutrition</h2>
        <p>Parasitic nutrition can have various impacts on both the parasite and the host:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Parasites can cause diseases or infections in the host, leading to negative health effects.</li>
          <li>The host's immune system may respond to the presence of parasites, resulting in inflammatory reactions or immune responses.</li>
          <li>Parasites may compete with the host for nutrients, potentially leading to malnutrition or reduced growth in the host.</li>
