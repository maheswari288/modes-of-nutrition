    <h1>Heterotrophic</h1>
    <p>Heterotrophic organisms are unable to produce their own food and depend on other sources for nutrition. They obtain organic compounds by various modes of heterotrophic nutrition.</p>
    <p>There are Four Modes of Heterotrophic Nutrition:</p>
    <ol class="nutrition-list">
      <li>
        <h2>Holozoic Nutrition:</h2>
        <p>Holozoic nutrition refers to a form of heterotrophic nutrition where an organism consumes complex organic food materials by ingesting them, followed by digestion and absorption of the nutrients into its body cells. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Saprophytic Nutrition:</h2>
        <p>Saprophytic nutrition is a process of chemoheterotrophic extracellular digestion involved in the processing of decayed organic matter. Saprophytes, also known as saprotrophs, are organisms that obtain their nutrition by decomposing dead organic matter. They are an important part of the ecosystem, as they play a key role in breaking down dead plants and animals and recycling nutrients back into the soil.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Parasitic Nutrition:</h2>
        <p>Parasitic Nutrition is a type of heterotrophic nutrition in which one organism (known as a parasite ex: tapeworms, fleas, and barnacles) lives on or inside the body of another type of organism (known as a host ex: Humans, dogs, cats, etc). The parasite receives food directly from the host.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Symbiotic Nutrition:</h2>
        <p>Symbiotic nutrition refers to the mutually beneficial relationship between two different organisms in which they both derive nutritional benefits from each other. This type of nutrition is often seen in the natural world, where it plays a crucial role in the survival and evolution of many different species.</p>
      </li>
