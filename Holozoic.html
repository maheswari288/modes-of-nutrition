        <h2 class="text-center">What is Holozoic Nutrition?</h2>
        <p>Holozoic nutrition is a type of nutrition observed in animals where they ingest solid food and then digest it internally. It involves the intake of complex organic substances, such as other organisms or their parts, for obtaining nutrients.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Holozoic nutrition is commonly found in most animals, including humans.</li>
          <li>Animals with holozoic nutrition possess specialized structures and organs involved in the ingestion, digestion, and absorption of food.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-center">Process of Holozoic Nutrition</h2>
        <p>The process of holozoic nutrition can be divided into several steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Ingestion: Animals consume solid food through various methods, such as biting, chewing, or swallowing.</li>
          <li>Digestion: The ingested food is broken down into simpler substances through mechanical and chemical processes.</li>
          <li>Absorption: Nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the digestive tract.</li>
          <li>Assimilation: The absorbed nutrients are transported to different cells and tissues in the body for energy production, growth, and repair.</li>
          <li>Egestion: Undigested waste materials, such as fiber or indigestible substances, are eliminated from the body through excretion.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-center">Examples of Holozoic Nutrition</h2>
        <p>Several animals exhibit holozoic nutrition, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lions: They hunt and consume other animals as their source of food.</li>
          <li>Humans: We consume a variety of foods, including plants and animals, to obtain nutrients for our survival.</li>
          <li>Snakes: They swallow their prey whole and digest it internally.</li>
          <li>Dogs: They consume a combination of meat and plant-based foods.</li>
          <li>Birds: Many birds consume insects, seeds, fruits, and other animals for nutrition.</li>
        </ul>

<h2 class="text-center">Advantages of Holozoic Nutrition</h2>
        <p>Holozoic nutrition offers several advantages to animals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Access to a wide range of nutrients: Animals with holozoic nutrition can consume a variety of food sources, allowing them to obtain a diverse range of essential nutrients.</li>
          <li>Energy production: The breakdown of complex food substances during digestion provides animals with the energy they need for various physiological processes.</li>
          <li>Growth and repair: Nutrients obtained through holozoic nutrition support growth, development, and repair of body tissues.</li>
        </ul>
