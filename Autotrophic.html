        <p>Autotrophic organisms are capable of producing their own food. They utilize various modes of nutrition to synthesize organic compounds from inorganic substances.</p>
        <p>In the autotrophic mode, organisms use simple inorganic matters like water and carbon dioxide in the presence of light and chlorophyll to synthesize food on their own. In other words, the process of photosynthesis is used to convert light energy into food such as glucose. Such organisms are called autotrophs.</p>
        <p>There are two main modes of autotrophic nutrition:</p>
        <ol class="nutrition-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Photosynthesis:</strong>
            <p>Photosynthesis is the process by which autotrophs convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy. They use this energy to combine carbon dioxide and water, producing glucose and oxygen as byproducts. Photosynthesis is primarily carried out by plants, algae, and some bacteria.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chemosynthesis:</strong>
            <p>Chemosynthesis is a mode of nutrition where autotrophs derive energy from chemical reactions instead of sunlight. They utilize inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia as energy sources. Chemosynthesis is typically observed in certain bacteria found in extreme environments like hydrothermal vents or caves.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Autotrophic organisms are fundamental to ecosystems as they serve as primary producers, supplying energy and nutrients for other organisms. They play a vital role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems and supporting life on Earth.</p>
        <strong style="color:dodgerblue;">Examples</strong>
        <p>Following are the Examples of Autotrophs:</p>
        <strong style="color:dodgerblue;">Plants</strong>
        <p>All plants with green leaves, from the tiniest mosses to towering fir trees, synthesize, or create, their own food through photosynthesis</p>

        <strong style="color:dodgerblue;">Bacteria</strong>
        <p>Bacteria that live in the deep ocean, near hydrothermal vents, also produce food through chemosynthesis.</p>
